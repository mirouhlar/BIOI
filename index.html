      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Reaction–diffusion systems are mathematical models which correspond to several physical phenomena. The most
        common is the change in space and time of the concentration of one or more chemical substances: local chemical
        reactions in which the substances are transformed into each other, and diffusion which causes the substances to
        spread out over a surface in space.

        Reaction–diffusion systems are naturally applied in chemistry. However, the system can also describe dynamical
        processes of non-chemical nature. Examples are found in biology, geology and physics (neutron diffusion theory)
        and ecology. Mathematically, reaction–diffusion systems take the form of semi-linear parabolic partial
        differential equations in general:
      </p>

      <p> \[ \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} = \mathbf{D} \nabla^2\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{R}(\mathbf{u})\]
        where \(\mathbf{u = u}(\mathbf{r,t})\) is a vector of concentration variables, \( \mathbf{R}(\mathbf{u})\)
        denotes a local reaction kinetics and \( \nabla^2 \) is a Laplace operator. \( \mathbf{D} \) denotes a diagonal
        diffusion coefficient matrix.
      </p>
      <h2>First mentioned</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" is an article that the English mathematician Alan Turing wrote in 1952. It
        describes how patterns in nature, such as stripes and spirals, can arise naturally from a homogeneous, uniform
        state. The theory, which can be called a reaction–diffusion theory of morphogenesis, has become a basic model in
        theoretical biology. Such patterns have come to be known as Turing patterns. For example, it has been postulated
        that the protein VEGFC can form Turing patterns to govern the formation of lymphatic vessels in the zebrafish
        embryo.

      </p>
      <br>
      <h2>Alan Turing</h2><br>
      <p>
        Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England—died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow,
        Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic,
        philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science,
        artificial intelligence, and artificial life. tu by trebalo dzabnut jeho fotku

      <h2>Proving the theory</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        For three decades, Turing’s theory on morphogenesis was largely ignored by biologists. But the combined arrival
        of powerful computers and the dawn of modern molecular cell biology, as well as the work of two generations of
        scientists who took Turing’s theory seriously from the 80s onwards, have contributed to proving it.

        Jeremy Green, professor of developmental biology at King’s College London, and his team provided one of the
        first non-theoretical proofs of Turing’s ideas in 2014, when they discovered that the ridges on the roof of a
        mouse’s mouth acted like stripes or spots in morphogenesis. They identified the two chemicals needed to produce
        this – and proved in mice that it works.

        ‘It’s been possible, but only in very recent times, to really test Turing’s theory,’ Professor Green says.
        ‘There are a relatively limited number of examples where people have done that in a rigorous way – skin being
        one, my research into the palate being another, and left-right asymmetry in fish being the third. Turing was
        right and we’ve now got the names [for the shape-formers].’ Broadly speaking, the morphogens in this case turned
        out to be protein growth factors, of which there are six main ones. ‘Each one of those six can come in a bunch
        of different flavours,’ says Green – so determining what the job of each morphogen is will be critical, as
        scientists come to programme stem cells to do certain things in the body.

        It might be counterintuitive to many of us, but it makes sense that a mathematician would look at patterns in
        biology and try to formulate an equation for their existence. It’s only now that scientists are realising quite
        how far ahead Turing’s thinking was.

      <h2> Use in modern world </h2><br>
      <p>
        Aided by modern computers, scientists have shown that Turing’s equations can be used to mimic countless
        two-dimensional patterns seen across the natural world

          target="_blank">Fingerprints - article</a> </u> <br>
      <p>Fingerprints represent a particular characteristic for each individual.
        Characteristic patterns are also formed on the palms of the hands and soles of the
        feet. Their origin and development is still unknown but it is believed to have a
        strong genetic component, although it is not the only thing determining its
        formation. Each fingerprint is a papillary drawing composed by papillae and rete
        ridges (crests). This paper proposes a phenomenological model describing fingerprint
        pattern formation using reaction diffusion equations with Turing space parameters.</p>

      <p>Turing began with the assumption
        that morphogens can react with one
        another and diffuse through cells. He
        then employed a mathematical model
        to show that if morphogens react and
        diffuse in an appropriate way, spatial
        patterns of morphogen concentrations can arise from an initial
        uniform distribution in an assemblage of cells. Turing's model has
        spawned an entire class of models
        that are now referred to as
        reaction-diffusion models. These
        models are applicable if the scale of
        the pattern is large compared with the
        diameter of an individual cell. The
        models are applicable to the leopard's
        coat, for instance, because the
        number of cells in a leopard spot at
        the time the pattern is laid down is
        probably on the order of 100. </p>

      <br>
      <h2>Gray-Scott model</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        The reaction-diffusion system described here involves two generic chemical species U and V, whose concentration
        at a given point in space is referred to by variables u and v. As the term implies, they react with each other,
        and they diffuse through the medium. Therefore the concentration of U and V at any given location changes with
        time and can differ from that at other locations.

        There are two reactions which occur at different rates throughout the space according to the relative
        concentrations at each point:
        \[ U + 2V \rightarrow 3V \]
        \[ V \rightarrow P \]

        P is an inert product. It is assumed for simplicity that the reverse reactions do not occur (this is a useful
        simplification when a constant supply of reagents prevents the attainment of equilibrium). Because V appears on
        both sides of the first reaction, it acts as a catalyst for its own production.

        The overall behavior of the system is described by the following formula, two equations which describe three
        sources of increase and decrease for each of the two chemicals:


        \[ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D_u \nabla^2u-uv^2+f(1-u)\]
        \[ \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = D_v \nabla^2v+uv^2-(f+k)v\]

        u=[U], the concentration of U, and v=[V]. For the sake of simplicity we can consider Du, Dv, f and k to be
        constant coefficients.
        <br>
        The first equation tells how quickly the quantity u increases. There are three terms. The first term, Du∇2u, is
        the diffusion term. It specifies that u will increase in proportion to the Laplacian (a sort of multidimensional
        second derivative giving the amount of local variation in the gradient) of U. When the quantity of U is higher
        in neighboring areas, u will increase. ∇2u will be negative when the surrounding regions have lower
        concentrations of U, and in such cases the diffusion term is negative and u decreases. If we made an equation
        for u with only the first term, we would have ∂u/∂t = Du∇2u, which is a diffusion-only system equivalent to the
        heat equation.
        <br><br>
        The second term is -uv2. This is the reaction rate. The first reaction shown above requires one U and two V;
        such a reaction takes place at a rate proportional to the concentration of U times the square of the
        concentration of V6. Also, it converts U into V: the increase in v is equal to the decrease in u (as shown by
        the positive uv2 in the second equation). There is no constant on the reaction terms, but the relative strength
        of the other terms can be adjusted through the constants Du, Dv, F and k, and the choice of the arbitrary time
        unit implicit in ∂t.
        <br><br>
        The third term, F(1-u), is the replenishment term. Since the reaction uses up U and generates V, all of the
        chemical U will eventually get used up unless there is a way to replenish it. The replenishment term says that u
        will be increased at a rate proportional to the difference between its current level and 1. As a result, even if
        the other two terms had no effect, 1 would be the maximum value for u. The constant F is the feed rate and
        represents the rate of replenishment.
        <br><br>
        In the systems this equation is modeling, the area where the reaction occurs is physically adjacent to a large
        supply of U and separated by something that limits its flow, such as a semi-permeable membrane; replenishment
        takes place via diffusion across the membrane, at a rate proportional to the concentration difference Δ[U]
        across the membrane. The value 1 represents the concentration of U in this supply area, and F corresponds to the
        permeability of the membrane.
        <br><br>
        It is useful to note here that in biological systems, such as the skin of a developing embryo, this "supply"
        could be from the bloodstream, or from cells in an adjacent layer of tissue that continuously generate the
        needed chemical(s), with rates regulated by enzymes.
        <br><br>
        Comparing the two equations, the biggest difference is in the third term, where we have F(1-u) in one equation
        and (F+k)v in the other. The third term in the v equation is the diminishment term. Without the diminishment
        term, the concentration of V could increase without limit. In practice, V could be allowed to accumulate for a
        long time without interfering with further production of more V, but it naturally diffuses out of the system
        through the same (or a similar) process as that which introduces the new supply of U. The diminishment term is
        proportional to the concentration of V that is currently present, and also to the sum of two constants F and k.
        F, as above, represents the permeability of the membrane to U, and k represents the difference between this rate
        and that for V.

        <h2>Solving method</h2><br>
        <p>We are going to obtain diffusion by Laplace function. Renew values according to the previous values, this
          dynamical system shown by using forward Euler integrations of the finite-difference equations.</p>
        <br>
        Forward Euler method:
        \[ \frac{\partial x}{\partial t} = f(x,t), \quad \quad x(t=0) = x_0 \]
        \[ x_{t+1} = x_t + f_t \Delta t \]
        <br>
        Finite-difference equations of Gray Scott model:
        <p>
          \[u_{t+1} = u_t + (D_{u}\nabla^2{u_t} - u_t{v_t}^2 + f(1-u_t))\,\Delta t \]
          \[v_{t+1} = v_t + (D_{v}\nabla^2{v_t} + u_t{v_t}^2 - (k+f)\,v_t)\,\Delta t \]
        </p>
        To obtain Laplace function we are using approximation by convolution with 3x3 mask.
        <div><br>
          <h2>Example</h2><br>
          We assume that values used in this example are: \[D_A=1.0, \quad D_B = 0.5, \quad f = 0.055, \quad k = 0.062,
          \quad \Delta t = 1 \]
          Convolution mask is \begin{matrix}0.05 & 0.2 & 0.05 \\ 0.2 & -1 & 0.2 \\ 0.05 & 0.2 & 0.05 \end{matrix}
